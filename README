  0. Thank you

  Thank you for downloading and trying this framework.

  This is a non-full-stack core-component layout PHP framework, which highly capable
to be extended and modified by developer's needs for providing a user friendly base
structure for software developing.

  1. Requirement

  The framework core needs PHP 5.4 at minimum. Some of Units needs specified extensions
to be enabled, there will be a warning when you try to use those Unit with out enabling
those extensions.

  Besides that, consider of the customizability of the framework, no any other component
will be required by force :)

  2. Installation

  Well, install this framework is easy. But also it's a long story. If this is the first
time you use it to help you to make a application. Please check wiki.

  If you can found nothing in wiki, you must also capable to found the the composer.json.
Which means you perhaps need a composer.

  Please check out https://packagist.org/packages/raincious/facula for more detail.

  3. Copyright

  Yeah, if you reading this file right now, the copy must be right. Otherwise, the copy is
not right so you may need to re-download it.

  I don't know why you want to copy this, because since you use git, fork it is more easy.

  This framework can also be git from:

  Oh, If you looking for document for redistribution, please check a file named LICENSE.

  4. Please notice

  Don't be too serious to the section 0, or the whole document above.

  5. Yeah, actually

  You may feel I'm not too welcome to people to try this framework. Yes, but not. Please
have fun reading the codes I written, leave issues when you discover any problem, or fork
it then push back.

  This framework basely is my own working experiment platform to test all the possibility
in my head. Code in this framework may not very stable and high quality, I will try to do
it as I should to, but no guarantees.

  So please do not use this framework on any of space ship, rocket, mars rover, even your
own car or anything you think that may critical.

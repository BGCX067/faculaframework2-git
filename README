  0. Thank you
  
  Thank you for download and try this framework.
  
  This framework designed for medium sized website which has minor traffic
to process and need an all-in-one solution for load balancing and multi 
databse support.
  
  For personal developer, this framework not a restriction to force you to use 
MVC pattern (You can use it when you want to of course). It provides lot of free-
dom and expandability in to your web develop and allows you to detailly controll 
the behavior of your application.
  
  1. Requirement
  
  This version of Facula Framework needs PHP 5.4 at minimum with few builtin 
extensions enabled. Besides that, consider of the customizability of the framework, 
no any other component will be require by force :)
  
  2. Installation
  
  Well, install this framework is easy. But also it's a long story. If this is 
the first time you use it to help you to make a application. Please check wiki.
  
  3. Copyright
  
  Yeah, if you reading this file right now, the copy must be right. Otherwise, 
the copy is not right.
  
  I don't know why you want to copy this, because since you use git, fork it 
is more easy.
